							<h1 class="major">Who am I?...</h1>

							<p>An aspiring developer entrallled by the world of coding, I left my previous profession in logistics after several years of service to purse a higher education in Information Technology. My motivations for changing where derived from the fact that I wanted to be in a field where active learning, not passive experience gain, is grounds for climbing the corporate ladder. Combined with a penchant for mathematics, IT became an obvious choice to try and master.</p>
							<p>I aim to grasp and improve many aspects of computing, even if its just as a hobby. Constricting myself to a one language, one framework or even one facet of software is a waste of opportunity and potential. As an avid learn and being capable of allocating resources and teaching myself, I find pleasure in knowing that I was able to work towards a goal and be a part of the developers' community. On that note, one of my recent addictions is to be proficient enough to contribute to projects and community driven efforts that taught and kept me motivated on my journey to code.</p>
